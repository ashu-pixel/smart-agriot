## Description
Our solution consisted of Smart agriculture farming system using IOT and Machine Learning. From crop prediction and tracking features of our system, results of the crop prediction will be made available to the farmer. Moreover this project help farmers in actual farming process by automatic watering system, providing security and local environmental conditions. It also helps farmers by website based plant disease detection system.Our main aim was to build a complete agriculture system which includes crop prediction and plant disease detection using machine learning , weather forecast prediction system and smart watering system using IoT.

* <ins>TRACKING FARMING USING QGIS: </ins> 
We aim to track agricultural production using QGIS , a geospatial software to track Rainfall , Temperature , Humidity , Location and other Crop parameters. We can also get location data which would help farmers to know what crops can be grown and in which area.


* <ins>CROP PREDICTION USING ML:</ins> 
Based on parameters like SEASON,LOCATION,TEMPERATURE,RAINFALL , HUMIDITY, we will predict crops an help farmers to grow the crops which to gain maximum benefit and yield.


* <ins>PRECAUTIONS NEEDED FOR SOWING SEEDS: </ins> 
User needs to see precautions while sowing the seeds.

* <ins>WEATHER FORECASTING: </ins> 
We are able to detect the weather forecast of the location of the plant to monitor its health.


* <ins>AUTOMATIC WATERING: </ins> 
Based on soil moisture content, automatically system will identify water deficient plant and water only that particular plant. It saves water.

* <ins><ins>AUTOMATIC WATERING: </ins>  </ins> 
Our project provides security from natural disasters like unconditional rain or fire. As well as our project protect farm from animals and birds.

* <ins>PROTECTION SYSTEM: </ins> 
We aim to detect the plant disease detection and give recommendations for curing the plant of that disease.

* <ins>CHATBOT </ins> 
It is user friendly feature which is added on user demand giving information about Ideal geographical conditions, water requirements, government schemes, etc.related to crop asked. By automating conversations it works as a conversational partner .

## Usage
Once you go on the website link that is given you can use multiple features of our website
1. Implemented a crop prediction system with a QGIS software for farmers to predict crops and get adequate details regarding it.
2. Implemented a plant disease detection webpage which helps farmers to detect diseases and give cure for it.
3. Provided weather forecasting feature to manage the schedule of farming activities and minimal wastage of crop due to unconditional changes in the weather.
4. Successfully designed smart watering system which can water to plants automatically and as per requirement only, which saves lot of water.

## Applications
1. The impact of climate change in India, most of the agricultural crops are being badly affected. Predicting the crop in advance of its production would help farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and storage. Implementation of such a system with an easy-to-use web based graphic user interface and the machine learning algorithm will be carried out. The results of the prediction will be made available to the farmer.
2. Overwatering decreases fertility of the soil as well so it is very important to use water in appropriate quantity. Watering is the key in region of scarcity of water. Due to unpredictable climate conditions large quantity of crops get affected every year. So, by understanding local surrounding data farmers can save their crops. 
3. Some animals or birds can also cause damage to crop hence secure farm from them is also important task. So by finding solution to all these problems we farmers can get maximum benefit in terms of efforts as well as cost. 


## Future scope
1. To add e-commerce for farming produce.
2. Balance supply chain management
3. To make project scalable
