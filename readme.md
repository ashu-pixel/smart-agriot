## Description
Our solution consisted of Smart agriculture farming system using IoT and Machine Learning. From crop prediction and tracking features of our system, results of the crop prediction will be made available to the farmer. Moreover this project help farmers in actual farming process by automatic watering system, providing security and local environmental conditions. 
Our role based disturbed system makes it possible for scaling and effective management of the farm. Users(farmers) can consult an expert and get help with their doubts.  

* <ins>TRACKING FARMING USING QGIS: </ins> 
We aim to track agricultural production using QGIS , a geospatial software to track Rainfall , Temperature , Humidity , Location and other Crop parameters. We can also get location data which would help farmers to know what crops can be grown and in which area.


* <ins>CROP PREDICTION USING ML:</ins> 
Based on parameters like NPK, pH, TEMPERATURE, RAINFALL, HUMIDITY, we will predict crops an help farmers to grow the crops which to gain maximum benefit and yield.
Real time market requirements are also taken into consideration for prediction to balance supply demand chain. 


* <ins>PRECAUTIONS NEEDED FOR SOWING SEEDS: </ins> 
User needs to see precautions while sowing the seeds.

* <ins>WEATHER FORECASTING: </ins> 
We are able to detect local and real time weather forecast of the location to monitor it's health.


* <ins> IoT BASED WATERING SYSTEM: </ins> 
Based on soil moisture content, automatically system will identify water deficient plant and water only that particular plant. It saves water.
Depending upon crop extra water might be needed in such case watering can be done in manual mode as well.

* <ins><ins>IoT BASED SECURITY: </ins>  </ins> 
Our project provides security from natural disasters like unconditional rain or fire. As well as our project protect farm from animals and birds.

* <ins>CONSULTING PLATFORM: </ins> 
We provide a platform where farmers can consult an expert in their locality.

## User manual
Once you go on the website link that is given you can use multiple features of our website
1. Implemented a crop prediction system with a QGIS software for farmers to predict crops and get adequate details regarding it.
2. Provided weather forecasting feature to manage the schedule of farming activities and minimal wastage of crop due to uncontrolled changes in the weather.
3. Designed smart watering system which can water plants automatically and as per requirement, saving a lot of water.

## Applications
1. The impact of climate change in India, most of the agricultural crops are being badly affected. Predicting the crop in advance of its production would help farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and storage. Implementation of such a system with an easy-to-use web based graphic user interface and the machine learning algorithm will be carried out. The results of the prediction will be made available to the farmer.
2. Overwatering decreases fertility of the soil as well so it is very important to use water in appropriate quantity. Watering is the key in region of scarcity of water. Due to unpredictable climate conditions large quantity of crops get affected every year. So, by understanding local surrounding data farmers can save their crops. 
3. Some animals or birds can also cause damage to crop hence secure farm from them is also important task. So by finding solution to all these problems we farmers can get maximum benefit in terms of efforts as well as cost. 
4. Although farmers are educated, they are not trained. They just need small push so that their farm can yield good quality of product. This is where our system comes into play through talk 2 pro and crop fact features.   


## Future scope
1. To add e-commerce for farming produce.
2. Multilingual, interactive chatbot to make farmers aware of government schemes.
3. Plant disease detection using CNN. (At present we are at labelled data collection stage)  
4. Soil nutrient monitoring system using ML
